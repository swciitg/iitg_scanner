# IITG Scanner
_Scan id-cards anytime, anywhere_

## 🙋‍♂️ Who are we?
This project was made by the Flutter Development Team, **Student's Web Committe**, IIT Guwahati. Primary contributor - [AB](https://github.com/Imperial-lord). Special thanks to [Alan](https://github.com/Alan451) for his help in testing.

## 🤔 Why did we make this?
We made this to ensure hassle free entry and exit of students in and out of the campus, especially keeping in mind the limitations and restrictions imposed by the pandemic situation.

## ⚙️ Tech-Stack
The application is built entirely with Flutter. For our backend services, we have made use of Firebase. We have also setup a CI/CD using GitHub Actions.
